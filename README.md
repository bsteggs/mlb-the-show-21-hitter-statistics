MLB Player Attributes Analysis (Python, Pandas, Seaborn)

This project analyzes player attributes from MLB The Show 21, exploring how skills like power, speed, and fielding impact overall player ratings and in-game effectiveness. Using Python, pandas, and seaborn, the project uncovers key trends in player performance, rarity tiers, and positional strengths.

Project Summary

- Analyzed player attributes to predict overall player ratings
- Identified key attributes that impact effectiveness across positions
- Explored how player rarity levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond) correlate with performance
- Created advanced visualizations (correlation heatmaps, box plots, violin plots) to highlight insights

Tools Used

- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

Key Features

- Attribute correlation heatmap for overall player ratings
- Positional attribute distributions (Power, Speed)
- Rarity tier analysis of player performance
- Business-focused insights for player evaluation

Data Source

- MLB The Show 21 Live Series Dataset (link or note if simulated)

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
